abstract={Rapid progress in the synthesis and processing of materials with structure on nanometer length scales has created a demand for greater scientific understanding of thermal transport in nanoscale devices, individual nanostructures, and nanostructured materials. This review emphasizes developments in experiment, theory, and computation that have occurred in the past ten years and summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces between materials become increasingly important on small length scales. The thermal conductance of many solid--solid interfaces have been studied experimentally but the range of observed interface properties is much smaller than predicted by simple theory. Classical molecular dynamics simulations are emerging as a powerful tool for calculations of thermal conductance and phonon scattering, and may provide for a lively interplay of experiment and theory in the near term. Fundamental issues remain concerning the correct definitions of temperature in nonequilibrium nanoscale systems. Modern Si microelectronics are now firmly in the nanoscale regime---experiments have demonstrated that the close proximity of interfaces and the extremely small volume of heat dissipation strongly modifies thermal transport, thereby aggravating problems of thermal management. Microelectronic devices are too large to yield to atomic-level simulation in the foreseeable future and, therefore, calculations of thermal transport must rely on solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation; microscopic phonon scattering rates needed for predictive models are, even for Si, poorly known. Low-dimensional nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, are predicted to have novel transport properties; the first quantitative experiments of the thermal conductivity of nanotubes have recently been achieved using microfabricated measurement systems. Nanoscale porosity decreases the permittivity of amorphous dielectrics but porosity also strongly decreases the thermal conductivity. The promise of improved thermoelectric materials and problems of thermal management of optoelectronic devices have stimulated extensive studies of semiconductor superlattices; agreement between experiment and theory is generally poor. Advances in measurement methods, e.g., the 3$\omega$ method, time-domain thermoreflectance, sources of coherent phonons, microfabricated test structures, and the scanning thermal microscope, are enabling new capabilities for nanoscale thermal metrology.},

abstract={Nanotechnology is being used to enhance conventional ceramic and polymeric water treatment membrane materials through various avenues. Among the numerous concepts proposed, the most promising to date include zeolitic and catalytic nanoparticle coated ceramic membranes, hybrid inorganic--organic nanocomposite membranes, and bio-inspired membranes such as hybrid protein--polymer biomimetic membranes, aligned nanotube membranes, and isoporous block copolymer membranes. A semi-quantitative ranking system was proposed considering projected performance enhancement (over state-of-the-art analogs) and state of commercial readiness. Performance enhancement was based on water permeability, solute selectivity, and operational robustness, while commercial readiness was based on known or anticipated material costs, scalability (for large scale water treatment applications), and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure. Overall, bio-inspired membranes are farthest from commercial reality, but offer the most promise for performance enhancements; however, nanocomposite membranes offering significant performance enhancements are already commercially available. Zeolitic and catalytic membranes appear reasonably far from commercial reality and offer small to moderate performance enhancements. The ranking of each membrane nanotechnology is discussed along with the key commercialization hurdles for each membrane nanotechnology.},

abstract={The all-solid-state lithium batteries using solid electrolytes are considered to be the new generation of devices for energy storage. Recent advances in this kind of rechargeable batteries have brought them much closer to a commercial reality. However, several challenges such as insufficient room temperature ionic conductivity (10−5{\textasciitilde}10−3 S cm−1) when compared to those of conventional organic liquid electrolytes (10−2 S cm−1), the difficulty in informing an effective electrode-electrolyte interface and insufficient fundamental understanding of the interfacial process after charge/discharge, hindering the reality of such devices. To accelerate the research and development, the overall picture about the current state of all solid-state lithium batteries was reviewed in this article with major focus on the material aspects, including inorganic ceramic and organic solid polymer electrolyte materials. In particular, the importance of the electrolytes and their associated interfaces with electrodes as well as their effects on the battery performance are emphasized by in-depth discussion and data analysis. To overcome the challenges, several possible research directions are also suggested for facilitating further improvement on the battery performance.},

Through great efforts in developing technology for controlled and localized heating, as well as better understanding of the mechanisms behind temperature-induced cell killing, modern thermal treatment has proven to be effective alone or when combined with other cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy [1].Although still in the early stages of development, ideal photothermal therapy (PTT) refers to treating cancer by targeted delivery of biocompatible photothermal nanoparticles and heat to the site of interest without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. Well-designed nanoparticles will generate heat after the absorption of nontoxic light, which is usually in the near-infrared (NIR) range (650--900 nm), for the killing of cancer cells. Considering the limited penetration depth (a few centimeters) of NIR light, as well as the varied locations of tumors in humans, the delivery of localized light may be either invasive or noninvasive. The efficiency of in vivo PTT depends greatly on the accumulation of light-responsive nanoparticles, the light-to-heat conversion efficiency and the light dose (i.e., light power density and light exciting time).Many nanomaterials of interest are currently being investigated for PTT, such as: noble metal nanostructures, such as gold (Au) nanoshells, Au nanorods, Au nanocages and palladium nanosheets [2,3]; carbon-based nanostructures, such as single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes [4], graphenes and their derivatives [5,6]; copper-based nanocrystals, such as copper sulfide and copper selenide [7,8]; and porphyrin-based nanoassemblies, such as porphysomes and nanoporphyrin [9,10]. Although encouraging photothermal ablation of tumors in small animals has been reported using these nanoparticles over the last decade [11], clinical translation is extremely slow, as very few of these approaches are now under clinical trials.Translational research of Au nanoshellsInitially invented by Naomi Halas and Jennifer West from Rice University in the mid-1990s, PEGylated silica-cored Au nanoshells are the first photothermal nanoparticles to have advanced into clinical trials, appearing as AuroShell® (Nanospectra Biosciences, TX, USA) particles in 2008 [12]. Preclinical studies confirmed the accumulation of nanoshells in tumors based on the enhanced permeability and retention effect after intravenous injection in mice [13]. Thermal ablation could then be achieved by the illumination of the tumor using NIR (808 nm) laser light delivered via fiber optics. Because nanoshells do not accumulate in healthy tissue, this AuroLase® therapy enabled the precise thermal ablation of the tumor along its irregular boundaries while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. A biomedical company named Nanospectra Biosciences was founded to promote this technology.Before clinical trials, systematic toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs were also carried out based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-10993 guidance standards for the biological evaluation of a medical device in order to fully investigate the biodistribution, clearance and acute toxicity of Au nanoshells [14]. Although long-term retention of the nanoshells in the reticuloendothelial system (the liver and spleen) was observed, no obvious toxicity was indicated in any of these studies. Similar issues are also seen in other nanoparticles of similar sizes, making this an unsurprising result.An efficacy study of AuroLase therapy in patients with primary and/or metastatic lung tumors is ongoing (NCT01679470) in the USA. Patients are given a systemic intravenous infusion of Au nanoshells and a subsequent escalating dose of laser radiation delivered by optical fibers via bronchoscopy. A second clinical trial is aiming to focus on treating patients with refractory and/or recurrent tumors of the head and neck (NCT00848042). Although the addition of targeting ligands to the surface of Au nanoshells could potentially improve their accumulation in tumors, as evidenced by the successful vascular-targeted PTT of glioma in mice [15], to date, Au nanoshells are expected to accumulate in patients purely based on the enhanced permeability and retention effect in these two clinical trials.New photothermal nanoparticlesDespite the long and costly process (10--15 years and millions of US dollars) of the first case of translating Au nanoshells to the clinic, preclinical studies with many newly discovered photothermal agents in laboratories around the world have shown encouraging results. For example, freestanding hexagonal palladium nanosheets with a thickness of less than 10 atomic layers were synthesized using carbon monoxide as a surface-confining agent. As-prepared nanosheets exhibited a well-defined but tunable surface plasmon resonance peak in the NIR region and enhanced photothermal stability when compared with conventional Au or silver nanostructures [3]. Copper selenide (Cu2-xSe) nanocrystals are another new type of photothermal agent with strong NIR optical absorption and a high molar extinction coefficient (7.7 {\texttimes} 107 cm-1M-1 at 980 nm) [8]. Through doping with copper-64 (64Cu; a radioisotope with a 12.7-h half-life), researchers also succeeded in integrating intrinsic PET imaging with PTT by developing [64Cu]CuS nanoparticles [7]. Although preliminary toxicity studies showed negative results in all of these newly developed nanoparticles, more systematic and long-term in vivo studies in different species are needed before clinical translation.In addition to the aforementioned inorganic-based photothermal agents, biodegradable porphyrin-based nanoassemblies are attractive organic nanomedicine agents that hold greater potential for clinical translation due to their simplicity and high biocompatibility [9,10]. In one study, porphysomes with unique photothermal and photoacoustic properties were synthesized from self-assembled phospholipid--porphyrin bilayers [9]. As-synthesized porphysomes were enzymatically biodegradable and induced only minimal acute toxicity in mice with an extremely high intravenous dose (1000 mg/kg). The potential of porphysomes as nanocarriers for loading 64Cu (or Mn3+ ions) in ordr to form an intrinsic PET (or MRI) agent has also been demonstrated recently [16,17], highlighting their great potential as a novel biodegradable theranostic nanomedicine.ConclusionThe last decade has demonstrated that nanomedicine-based PTT is a highly promising cancer management technique. Although the photothermal nanoparticles reported so far have been focused on proof-of-concept PTT demonstrations in small animals, we believe that more clinical trials of photothermal nanoparticles will be approved by the US FDA, and the currently ongoing clinical trials of Au nanoshells will bring us one step closer to curing cancer by targeted PTT.Future perspectivePreclinical research of PTT will continue to grow quite quickly in the next decade. Although adding targeting ligands to the surface of photothermal nanoparticles could mean additional synthetic steps, costs and greater regulatory hurdles during good manufacturing practice [18], the engineering of tumor actively targeted photothermal nanoparticles holds a greater chance for higher accumulation efficacy of nanoparticles in the tumor site and will become one of the important directions for research in the next few years. Image-guided PTT and the combination of thermal therapy with conventional chemotherapy will be other promising research areas, considering that most photothermal nanoparticles are also photoacoustic imaging agents [19] and the already-demonstrated synergistic effects of thermochemotherapy (or thermoradiotherapy) [20].Great challenges still exist for pushing photothermal nanoparticles from the bench to bedside. Caution needs to be taken when selecting the best nanoplatform. Nanoparticles that contain heavy metal elements or cannot be degraded in vivo may find it difficult to be approved by the FDA due to their long-term toxicity concerns. Thus, liposome-like and biodegradable porphysomes with a strong NIR absorption capability might become the next promising nanomedicines for entering clinical trials. In addition, most nanoparticles are known to lose their uniformity and reproducibility when production is scaled up. Therefore, great efforts are needed in order to ensure the high quality control (e.g., good laboratory practice and good manufacturing practice) of nanoparticles that are to be translated. Finally, closer partnership among academic researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical industries, the National Cancer Institute and the FDA is necessary in order to promote the translational research of promising photothermal nanoparticles.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank EB Ehlerding for helpful proofreading.Financial {\&} competing interests disclosureThis work is supported, in part, by the University of Wisconsin--Madison, the NIH (NIBIB/NCI 1R01CA169365, P30CA014520), the Department of Defense (W81XWH-11-1-0644) and the American Cancer Society (125246-RSG-13-099-01-CCE).

abstract={The aim of this review article on recent developments of mechanochemistry (nowadays established as a part of chemistry) is to provide a comprehensive overview of advances achieved in the field of atomistic processes, phase transformations, simple and multicomponent nanosystems and peculiarities of mechanochemical reactions. Industrial aspects with successful penetration into fields like materials engineering, heterogeneous catalysis and extractive metallurgy are also reviewed. The hallmarks of mechanochemistry include influencing reactivity of solids by the presence of solid-state defects, interphases and relaxation phenomena, enabling processes to take place under non-equilibrium conditions, creating a well-crystallized core of nanoparticles with disordered near-surface shell regions and performing simple dry time-convenient one-step syntheses. Underlying these hallmarks are technological consequences like preparing new nanomaterials with the desired properties or producing these materials in a reproducible way with high yield and under simple and easy operating conditions. The last but not least hallmark is enabling work under environmentally friendly and essentially waste-free conditions (822 references).},

abstract={Over the past few decades, metal nanoparticles less than 100 nm in diameter have made a substantial impact across diverse biomedical applications, such as diagnostic and medical devices, for personalized healthcare practice. In particular, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have great potential in a broad range of applications as antimicrobial agents, biomedical device coatings, drug-delivery carriers, imaging probes, and diagnostic and optoelectronic platforms, since they have discrete physical and optical properties and biochemical functionality tailored by diverse size- and shape-controlled AgNPs. In this review, we aimed to present major routes of synthesis of AgNPs, including physical, chemical, and biological synthesis processes, along with discrete physiochemical characteristics of AgNPs. We also discuss the underlying intricate molecular mechanisms behind their plasmonic properties on mono/bimetallic structures, potential cellular/microbial cytotoxicity, and optoelectronic property. Lastly, we conclude this review with a summary of current applications of AgNPs in nanoscience and nanomedicine and discuss their future perspectives in these areas.},

abstract={The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonrenewable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest energies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed. Briefly, this review presents the broad spectrum of piezoelectric materials for clean power supply to wireless electronics in diverse fields.},

abstract={Colloidal synthesis offers a route to nanoparticles (NPs) with controlled composition and structural features. This Perspective describes the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain such nanostructures. PVP can serve as a surface stabilizer, growth modifier, nanoparticle dispersant, and reducing agent. As shown with examples, its role depends on the synthetic conditions. This dependence arises from the amphiphilic nature of PVP along with the molecular weight of the selected PVP. These characteristics can affect nanoparticle growth and morphology by providing solubility in diverse solvents, selective surface stabilization, and even access to kinetically controlled growth conditions. This Perspective includes discussions of the properties of PVP-capped NPs for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), assembly, catalysis, and more. The contribution of PVP to these properties as well as its removal is considered. Ultimately, the NPs accessed through the use of PVP in colloidal syntheses are opening new applications, and the concluding guidelines provided herein should enable new nanostructures to be accessed facilely.},

abstract={Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs, i.e., crystalline nanoparticles) have become an important class of materials with great potential for applications ranging from medicine to electronic and optoelectronic devices. Today's strong research focus on NCs has been prompted by the tremendous progress in their synthesis. Impressively narrow size distributions of just a few percent, rational shape-engineering, compositional modulation, electronic doping, and tailored surface chemistries are now feasible for a broad range of inorganic compounds. The performance of inorganic NC-based photovoltaic and light-emitting devices has become competitive to other state-of-the-art materials. Semiconductor NCs hold unique promise for near- and mid-infrared technologies, where very few semiconductor materials are available. On a purely fundamental side, new insights into NC growth, chemical transformations, and self-organization can be gained from rapidly progressing in situ characterization and direct imaging techniques. New phenomena are constantly being discovered in the photophysics of NCs and in the electronic properties of NC solids. In this Nano Focus, we review the state of the art in research on colloidal NCs focusing on the most recent works published in the last 2 years.},

abstract={A biosensor is an integrated receptor-transducer device, which can convert a biological response into an electrical signal. The design and development of biosensors have taken a center stage for researchers or scientists in the recent decade owing to the wide range of biosensor applications, such as health care and disease diagnosis, environmental monitoring, water and food quality monitoring, and drug delivery. The main challenges involved in the biosensor progress are (i) the efficient capturing of biorecognition signals and the transformation of these signals into electrochemical, electrical, optical, gravimetric, or acoustic signals (transduction process), (ii) enhancing transducer performance i.e., increasing sensitivity, shorter response time, reproducibility, and low detection limits even to detect individual molecules, and (iii) miniaturization of the biosensing devices using micro-and nano-fabrication technologies. Those challenges can be met through the integration of sensing technology with nanomaterials, which range from zero- to three-dimensional, possessing a high surface-to-volume ratio, good conductivities, shock-bearing abilities, and color tunability. Nanomaterials (NMs) employed in the fabrication and nanobiosensors include nanoparticles (NPs) (high stability and high carrier capacity), nanowires (NWs) and nanorods (NRs) (capable of high detection sensitivity), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (large surface area, high electrical and thermal conductivity), and quantum dots (QDs) (color tunability). Furthermore, these nanomaterials can themselves act as transduction elements. This review summarizes the evolution of biosensors, the types of biosensors based on their receptors, transducers, and modern approaches employed in biosensors using nanomaterials such as NPs (e.g., noble metal NPs and metal oxide NPs), NWs, NRs, CNTs, QDs, and dendrimers and their recent advancement in biosensing technology with the expansion of nanotechnology.},

abstract={Recently, iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted much consideration due to their unique properties, such as superparamagnetism, surface-to-volume ratio, greater surface area, and easy separation methodology. Various physical, chemical, and biological methods have been adopted to synthesize magnetic NPs with suitable surface chemistry. This review summarizes the methods for the preparation of iron oxide NPs, size and morphology control, and magnetic properties with recent bioengineering, commercial, and industrial applications. Iron oxides exhibit great potential in the fields of life sciences such as biomedicine, agriculture, and environment. Nontoxic conduct and biocompatible applications of magnetic NPs can be enriched further by special surface coating with organic or inorganic molecules, including surfactants, drugs, proteins, starches, enzymes, antibodies, nucleotides, nonionic detergents, and polyelectrolytes. Magnetic NPs can also be directed to an organ, tissue, or tumor using an external magnetic field for hyperthermic treatment of patients. Keeping in mind the current interest in iron NPs, this review is designed to report recent information from synthesis to characterization, and applications of iron NPs.},

abstract={Focusing on nanocrystalline (nc) pure face-centered cubic metals, where systematic experimental data are available, this paper presents a brief overview of the recent progress made in improving mechanical properties of nc materials, and in quantitatively and mechanistically understanding the underlying mechanisms. The mechanical properties reviewed include strength, ductility, strain rate and temperature dependence, fatigue and tribological properties. The highlighted examples include recent experimental studies in obtaining both high strength and considerable ductility, the compromise between enhanced fatigue limit and reduced crack growth resistance, the stress-assisted dynamic grain growth during deformation, and the relation between rate sensitivity and possible deformation mechanisms. The recent advances in obtaining quantitative and mechanics-based models, developed in line with the related transmission electron microscopy and relevant molecular dynamics observations, are discussed with particular attention to mechanistic models of partial/perfect-dislocation or deformation-twin-mediated deformation processes interacting with grain boundaries, constitutive modeling and simulations of grain size distribution and dynamic grain growth, and physically motivated crystal plasticity modeling of pure Cu with nanoscale growth twins. Sustained research efforts have established a group of nanocrystalline and nanostructured metals that exhibit a combination of high strength and considerable ductility in tension. Accompanying the gradually deepening understanding of the deformation mechanisms and their relative importance, quantitative and mechanisms-based constitutive models that can realistically capture experimentally measured and grain-size-dependent stress--strain behavior, strain-rate sensitivity and even ductility limit are becoming available. Some outstanding issues and future opportunities are listed and discussed.},

abstract={Nanostructured materials gained great importance in the past decade on account of their wide range of potential applications in many areas. A large interest is devoted to carbon nanotubes that exhibit exceptional electrical and mechanical properties and can therefore be used for the development of a new generation of composite materials. Nevertheless, poor dispersion and poor interfacial bonding limit the full utilization of carbon nanotubes for reinforcing polymeric media. In this paper, recent advances on carbon nanotubes and their composites will be presented through results of the author's research, essentially based on filled elastomeric networks. The intrinsic potential of carbon nanotubes as reinforcing filler in elastomeric materials will be demonstrated. It will be shown that, despite a poor dispersion, small filler loadings improve substantially the mechanical and electrical behaviors of the soft matrix. With the addition of 1 phr of multiwall carbon nanotubes in a styrene--butadiene copolymer, a 45{\%} increase in modulus and a 70{\%} increase in the tensile length are achieved. Straining effects investigated by atomic force microscopy and infrared and Raman spectroscopies, provide interesting results for the understanding of the mechanical behavior of these nanotube-based composites. All the experimental data lead to the belief that the orientation of the nanotubes plays a major role in the mechanical reinforcement. The strong restriction in equilibrium swelling in toluene with the MWNT content is not ascribed to filler--matrix interfacial interactions but to the occlusion of rubber into the aggregates. On the other hand, carbon nanotubes impart conductivity to the insulator matrix. Between 2 and 4 phr, the conductivity increases by five orders of magnitude reflecting the formation of a percolating network. Changes in resistivity under uniaxial extension completed by AFM observations of stretched composites bring new insights into the properties of these composites by highlighting the contribution of orientational effects.},
