# Profile
I am a Physics student at State University of Semarang. I am known as a committed person to working as a collaborative and positive in the team member. I love to study optical sensor such as (Waveguide sensor and SERS sensor) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have been working on an AI program, namely VAII in the Habibie Tech Fest 2021 International Competition in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Culture, Intel, and LinkedIn. I like to learn other news things outside my experience and doing research in the lab with my colleagues. I am humble to ask and learn from my colleagues
